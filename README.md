# DW2-TT (Digimon World 2 Tiny Tool)

A Digimon World 2 Utility Tool with multiple features including an EXP & Bits Multiplier that increases EXP and bits by a chosen modifier for players who find the game too grindy. It also includes a Save Editor for editing save files, along with various Quality of Life (QoL) tweaks, fixes, and enhancements. This tool works with the vanilla game and will likely be compatible with other mods as well.


***Key Features***:
- Increase EXP & Bits of Enemy Encounters.
- Save Editor.
- Extract and Insert Game Files (including hidden ones).
- Unhide AAA Folder.
- Support DW2 Vanilla and Mods versions.
- Support US and Japanese versions (Some Patches).
- Support PS2 Pops (VCD) image.
- Remove Digi-Labs Restrictions.
- Expand Hero and Digi-Beetle Names.
- Improve some Battle Effects.
- Fix **misbehaviour** Techs and others that **cause** Crash or Soft-lock during Battle.


Check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for complete Features.
Check [here](Documentation/file-manager.md) for how to use the File-Manager.


***Note***:
- After using this tool some emulators will not work due to EDC/ECC issues, use any EDC/ECC tools like [ECCRegen](http://web.tiscali.it/eccregen) after making any modification and before burning to a physical CD.
- The patches are *not* compaitable with previous version, use it on a clean (vanilla / mod) game image.

    1.1 (Optional) Export "ENEMYSET.BIN" to different location for backup.
